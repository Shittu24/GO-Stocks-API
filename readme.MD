# STOCKS API With GO

## Introduction

This is a simple stocks API built with Go and postgres database where users can create a new stock by adding the stocks name, price and the company that owns the stock. After creating several stocks, users can view all stocks, update stocks, delete stocks and also get a specific stock provided the stock id is known.
